COUNT COACH
1. Brief summary of what your project does
As someone extremely interested in fusion dance (& the numerous styles like South, Hip-Hop, and Bhangra), I wanted to make something that would be somewhat applicable to me. One issue I struggle with ALL THE TIME, is being unable to count beats in my head properly. Especially in dance mixes which have numerous different songs, I struggled a lot with counting them, and I always wanted an external source to validate my counting. Thus, Count Coach was born. Essentially, you can drop a dance mix into the software via a file, and it will create a metronome that you can run concurrently with the file that plays at the same BPM. 
2. Which features you chose to include
My project utilizes components, animations, API Calls, Classes & Objects, Linking Front-end & Back-end, & Deployment 
3. How much time you spent developing this project
Honestly, this project has beeen on my mind for a while. Initially, prior to this week, I utilized Python's librosa library to analyze the mixes, but I ran into issues given that dance mixes in the DDN circuit usually have songs playing at varying BPMs, so I added a methodology of isolating certain parts of the songs that you want. However, this rendition probably took around 7-8 hours in total just a lot of it spent on debugging faulty code, and navigating Git.
